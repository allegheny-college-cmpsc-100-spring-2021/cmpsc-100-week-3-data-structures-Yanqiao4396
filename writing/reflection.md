# CMPSC 100: Lab 3 reflection

Yanqiao Chen

## Describe how this week's lab uses `list`s.

In this week's lab, list works as a box. A place for a mount of elements to settle.

## Here you used more than one `while` loop. What was the function of each?

I use the first one to ask users if he/she wants to add more items into the box. As to the second one, its work is to make sure the box is empty. If the box is not, then this while loop will delete or take out this late item I put in before.

## This lab also requested that you use a `for` loop to list the contents of the `box` list. In your own words, what's the difference between the way that `while` and `for` loops work?

I'm not so sure about the differences bewteen these two ones. In my opinion, 'while' loops have a condition. For this, 'while' loops allow user to deicide if you want to get out of loop. As for 'for' loops, they can work for lists, which is while loops can't do. Plus, 'for' loops will be over after computing all elements in the list. One more difference, you should define assignments before using the 'while' loops but you don't have to do it by using 'for' loops.

## In your own words, what was the benefit of using a `list` in this lab?

You can put a lot of elements in a list. So it's convenient when you need to use more than 1 variable. Additionally, since you have indexes, you don't have to type elements every time. 

## Would you help G. Wiz move again if they asked you?

Yes, they are my friends.
